          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1D1D1F]">1. The Flaw of "AI Wrapper" Architectures in Regulated Trade</h3>
          <p>
            Most legacy trade compliance vendors approach artificial intelligence by taking existing 20-year-old monolithic software and wrapping an LLM API call around a form field. When an import line item needs classification, they send a raw prompt to a model and display the answer in a text box.
          </p>
          <p>
            In regulated international trade, this approach is fundamentally broken. LLMs are probabilistic engines designed for fluid text generation, whereas customs compliance (CBP 19 U.S.C., HTSUS, General Rules of Interpretation) is strictly deterministic and legally binding. An ungrounded wrapper will inevitably hallucinate tariff codes, miss Section 301 surcharges, or fail Partner Government Agency (FDA/EPA) flags—leaving the importer liable for massive customs penalties.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1D1D1F]">2. What Does "AI-Native" Architecture Actually Mean?</h3>
          <p>
            Being <strong>AI-native</strong> does not mean giving an AI model full autonomous control to write directly to your database or file entries with customs authorities. True AI-native architecture decouples stateful execution, deterministic validation, and model intelligence into distinct service layers:

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1D1D1F]">3. The Hard Trust Boundary: Why Investors & Enterprise Clients Trust Qubere</h3>
          <p>
            Notice the red bar at the bottom of our logical architecture diagram: <strong>"Hard boundary: models cannot directly submit declarations, change policy, or write authoritative master data."</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This circuit breaker is hardcoded into our system architecture. By enforcing that AI models act purely as an evidence-backed proposal layer while deterministic engines and authorized humans act as the gateway, Qubere delivers sub-second automation speeds without taking on compliance risk.
